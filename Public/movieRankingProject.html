<h1>Best Movies According to Spirit</h1>
<h2>These are my top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Labyrinth - 1986</h3>
<p>Labyrinth is by far my number 1 movie of all-time.  It has fantastical elements and is a great coming of age story.  I have seen it probably a few dozen times and can likely recite it line after line.</p>
<h3>Legend - 1985</h3>
<p>Legend is one of my favorite movies.  Tim Curry plays a magnificant and tempting demon and Tom Cruise is the hero.  Long before my birth but this one is another childhood classic for me.</p>
<h3>Firefly/Serenity - 2002/2005</h3>
<p>Sadly this TV series and accompanying movie never got to take off but is a favorite of many a nerd.  Space. Opera.  It is funny.  Take a watch!</p>
